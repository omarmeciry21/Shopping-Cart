## Shopping Cart App

Hey everyone! This is my latest project accomplished by Flutter as the front-end of the app and Google Firebase as the back-end. In this app, I managed to implement clean architecture through three separated layers:
 
 - UI
 - Data Access
 - Core

# UI Layer
The first layer of the project was the user interface of the applications. It includes all the screens and the widgets used in the app. It also contains any needed structures for managing the UI such as change notifiers.

The screens contained in the app are:
- Home
- Favourites
- Featured Products
- View Category
- My Cart
- My Orders
- Submit Order
- Profile
- Splash Screen
- Login
- Register
- Reset Password
- About Us
- Contact Us

# Data Access Layer
